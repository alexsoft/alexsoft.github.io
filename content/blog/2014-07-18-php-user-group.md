Today I gave a talk on first PHP User Group in Dnipropetrovsk. I spoke about Laravel and all the main reasons why
every PHP developer should at least try this cool framework.

This was my very first speech at conference. I was quite nervous but still very excited about it!

Unfortunately, talk was not recorded.

Venue of event: DataArt @ Dnipropetrovsk.
